This project explains the complete process of building and deploying a machine learning model in a simple, beginner-friendly way. It covers data preprocessing, model creation using TensorFlow and Keras, and the use of layers like Dense, Dropout, and LSTM. The model is trained and tested to evaluate its performance, and finally deployed as a real-time web application using tools like Flask or Streamlit. This end-to-end project provides a clear understanding of how to develop, train, and deploy ML models effectively.
